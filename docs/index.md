# Getting Started

RSP is a RESTful API that provides a centralized way for game developers to access and manage player data across different games and platforms. This guide will help you set up your development environment and make requests to the RSP API.

### Prerequisites

Before you can start integrating RSP into your game, make sure you have the following:

- **Account Credentials**: Create an account with us to obtain your unique `RSP_KEY`. This key is required to authenticate your requests to the RSP API.

### Making Requests to RSP

RSP is a RESTful API, allowing you to make HTTP requests in your preferred programming language. The following sections provide examples in popular game development languages.

=== "Python"
    ``` py
    import requests
    from tictactokens.settings import RSP_KEY, RSP_URL

    rsp_headers = {"RSP_KEY": RSP_KEY}
    response = requests.get(f"{RSP_URL}/get_game_info/", headers=rsp_headers)
    ```

In the code snippet above, ensure that you replace `RSP_KEY` with your actual RSP key and `RSP_URL` with the appropriate base URL for the RSP API.

### RSP Key Best Practices

To ensure the security of your RSP key and protect it from unauthorized access, consider implementing the following guidelines and best practices:

- **Secret Management**: Treat your RSP key as a secret and avoid hardcoding it directly in your game's source code or configuration files. Instead, store it securely in a dedicated secrets management system or environment variable.

- **Access Control**: Limit the access and distribution of the RSP key to only authorized personnel. Follow the principle of least privilege, providing the key only to those who require it for integration purposes.

- **Secure Communication**: When making requests to the RSP API, ensure that you use secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS) to encrypt the data transmitted between your game and the RSP servers. This helps protect the confidentiality and integrity of your requests and responses.

- **Auditing and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the usage of the RSP key within your game application. Regularly review the logs to detect any suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

- **Secure Development Practices**: Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or unintentional exposure of sensitive data. Be cautious when logging or debugging your game, ensuring that the RSP key is not inadvertently included in log files or error messages.

<!-- - Key Rotation: Periodically rotate your RSP key to mitigate the risk of compromise. Establish a key rotation policy and update the key at regular intervals or in response to any security incidents. -->

## Error and Response Handling

When interacting with the RSP API, it is important to understand the error handling and response format to effectively handle responses and troubleshoot integration issues. While the exact formatting of every endpoint's response may vary, RSP follows a standard format.

=== "Python"
    ``` py
    sample_response_data = {
        'results': [...],
        'has_next_page': True,
        'cursor': a1sd3iu7ag_32jf93nf84fk39Rgknmm08nf,
    }

    response = { "success": True, "response": sample_response_data }
    ```
=== "C#"
    ``` cs
    var sampleResponseData = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        { "results", [...] },
        { "has_next_page", true },
        { "cursor", "a1sd3iu7ag_32jf93nf84fk39Rgknmm08nf" },
    };

    var response = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        { "success", true },
        { "response", sampleResponseData },
    };
    ```

### Response Structure

The response from the RSP API typically consists of two main parts:

- **Success**: The `success` field indicates whether the requested action was able to execute without any errors or if any of the requested information was successfully retrieved. It is a boolean value, where `True` signifies successful execution, and `False` indicates an error or unsuccessful operation.

- **Response**: The `response` field contains the information relevant to the requested action or retrieved data. Its structure may vary depending on the specific endpoint. In the example above, the `sample_response_data` dictionary provides the `results`, `has_next_page`, and `cursor` information.

        If the `success` field is `False`, the `response` field will contain an error message explaining why the operation was unsuccessful.

### Error Handling

When an error occurs, the RSP API will typically return a response indicating the error condition. Although the specific error format may vary, it is important to handle errors gracefully. Here are some general guidelines for error handling when integrating with the RSP API:

- **Conditional Checking**: Before processing the response data, check the success field. If it is True, proceed with further processing. If it is False, handle the error condition and provide appropriate feedback to users or take necessary actions in your game application.

- **Error Messages**: Extract error messages from the response if available. Error messages can provide useful information for troubleshooting or displaying to users in case of errors. Incorporate these messages into your error handling logic.

- **Logging and Debugging**: Implement logging and error tracking mechanisms within your game application to capture any errors or exceptions that occur during interactions with the RSP API. This information can be invaluable for diagnosing and resolving integration issues.
